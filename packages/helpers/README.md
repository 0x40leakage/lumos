# `@ckb-lumos/helpers`

Helper utilities for working with CKB transactions from lumos.

The difference between this and `@ckb-lumos/types`, is that `@ckb-lumos/types` contains only core definitions, while this module contains utilities used in a framework sense. One example is: you can pretty much use `@ckb-lumos/types` as a standalone library, while this library integrates more with `config` module so it knows whether the framework is running under testnet, or mainnet environment.

## Usage

```
const helpers = require('@ckb-lumos/helpers');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
